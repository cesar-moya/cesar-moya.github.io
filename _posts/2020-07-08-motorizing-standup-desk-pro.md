*This post is still on DRAFT. I'll update the final version very soon!*

This is a continuation to my previous post [How I motorized my Ikea SKARSTA standup desk with an Arduino UNO](/blog/motorizing-standup-desk){:target="_blank"}. Please read that first if you haven't already.

The automation project from my previous post is very much functional and I'm happy with it. But if you are a little crazy and don't want to waste a whole Arduino board on it and you want to take it to the next level... Behold the ATMEGA328P MicroController.
