I am a software developer and tecnology enthusiast with interest on Artificial Intelligence, Science, Astrophysics, Electronics, Automation Projects, Economics, Video Games, Board Games, Music, Photography, and much more!.

In this blog I will attempt to share some of the things I find out interesting and could potentially benefit other people on this very wide variety of themes.
